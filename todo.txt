bug: got D-2 from the deck twice in a row while playing

keep testing auto and step to debug changes - get through 3 games w/out incident

bug: seems like waste gets played when there is already a closer horse

bug: $ is given on recycle

only show $ if vegas rules are in effect

stats

remember revealed deck cards for possible interim consolidation sources after 1st pass

reorganize tableaus in order to feed foundations 

debug commands to reveal hidden cards

tree-based autoplay where multiple play options branch out to determine if a hand is winnable

auto move pseudo code

move any fitting stock or tableau cards to the foundations 

can any of the tableaus be consolidated?
- for each tableau
- get the lowest face up card
- for each tableau
- can the card me moved to the top of this pile?: move
- if it would leave >1 empty piles, do we wait?
- otherwise if yes move
- repeat until no more can be consolidated

can the stock card be played?
- for each place it cam be played
- king in a empty pile, go for it
- for each other tableau
- get first face up
- would playing the stock there get us closer to consolidating this pile?
  - is same polarity as target pile?
  - is less than card in play
- and is there not already a better candidate for that consolidation?
  - for each tableau other than the two under consideration
  - same polarity?
  - top card < card in play and > consolidation card then pass 
- if yes play the card there

restart whole process afrer every move

when the whole process fails to result in a move, pass instead, skipping to the stock step

when a full cycle of the stack has eesulted in no moves, forfeit

consider insrances where behavior is based on memory of waste

whe a king is down and still a short stack, dont put a king of the same color down from stock if we remember that a king of the other color is in the waste/stock and would better allow a consolidation

deprioritize a consolidation that would leave a blank pile when there is aleeady a blank pile unless we remember that there are helpful kings to fill it in stock/waste

look for foundation-ready cards mid pile in the tableau and look for/workntowards consolidations that would expose that card

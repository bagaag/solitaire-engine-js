# solitaire-engine-js

A Klondike solitaire game engine built for Node.js using only vim and Termux on an Android phone. It can be used as a library but comes with a workable console client.

To run:

1. install Node.js if not already available
2. clone this repo to a local folder
3. in a console, cd to the cloned folder and enter `node .`

You can also run anywhere using the `solitaire` command by running `npm install -g .` from the cloned folder.
